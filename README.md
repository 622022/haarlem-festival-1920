* Page info display system
* Add customer table (M)

# Setup
1. Make sure the `config/credentials.php` is correct.
2. Make sure you imported `import-database.sql` to your database.

# Random fricking ideas
* Unique ID/Barcode linked to ticket
* Need customer with first name and email
* Only one event page
* Make simple frontend pages first then bother with functionality
* Make section folder for repeatable interface sections (php include 'em)
